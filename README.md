# ThesisProject
Designed an end-to-end single-channel EEG signal ClassiÔ¨Åcation system that automates the processing of brain waves, addresses a major challenge of event detection within timeseries data and the code is a simple ML model that requires tuning just 1 parameter instead of DL model that has up to 39K trainable parameters.
